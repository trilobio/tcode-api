Locations
==============

Locations are the data structures that represent physical locations in the space of a fleet.
Locations can be defined in many ways (transforms, objects, coordinates, etc.) and relative to
many other entites.

  Many locations use the :py:class:`tcode_api.types.Matrix` structure to represent
  3D transforms. To create these easily, see :py:class:`tcode_api.utilities.create_transform`
  method.
